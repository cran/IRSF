Description: Builds ensemble survival tree models to reveal variable interactions when the response is a time-to-events outcome. Codes contain randomization, interaction modeling, and prediction subroutines to be used in addition to the following R packages: 'survival' for Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression modeling, 'randomForestSRC' for RSF modeling, and optionally 'ggRandomForests' for Random Forest exploration/visualization. The current version contains additional R codes in folder "/inst/doc" for the analysis and generation of results shown in the corresponding article (Dazard et al. (2018) <doi:10.1515/sagmb-2017-0038>). 
Depends: R (>= 3.5.0)
